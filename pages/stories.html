	<p id="parastories">On my days off I try my best to pursue my passions. If I'm not working on my own music I am helping my friends and family with their music. I find joy in hearing an instrumental or helping my producer make one. It's like an artist with a blank canvas, the outcome is fullfilling. To go from nothing to something that people can enjoy is a feeling I strive for. Which is why I find coding an artform. To build an app or website for people's enjoyment is my goal. Another passion of mine is attending the gym. Although I haven't been able to go to the gym as frequently as I used to, I still find a way to fit it in my current schedule. </p>
